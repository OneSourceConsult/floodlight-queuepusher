# Floodlight QueuePusher

This is a module to be installed within Floodlight[üîó](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/) to facilitate the installation of Queues in Open vSwitches.

## Objective

With the intention of providing an interface inside the Floodlight controller to ease the process of queue creation within an OF enabled switch, in particular the Open vSwitch (OVS), the QueuePusher was created. This entity presents itself as an extension to Floodlight, a module per se, rather than as a standalone application; following this approach allows the QueuePusher to be easily embedded in every Floodlight installation and also to enable Floodlight to handle all the event processing, avoiding the creation of additional overheads on the controller communication.

## Features

- Uses OVSDB protocol to communicate with Open vSwitches
- Complete integration with Floodlight REST API

## Requirements

To successfully install and run Floodlight with the QueuePusher, the following requirements should be met. Though it might work with earlier or later versions of the given software, as well as different releases (like OpenJDK), it has not been tested:

- Oracle Java Virtual Machine ‚â• 1.6
- Floodlight == 0.9
- Open vSwitch ‚â• 1.9.3 (tested with == 2.0.0 as well)
- curl ‚â• 7.22.0

**Note:** Since this is provided as a module, it is at least expected from you to know how to build Floodlight.

## Usage

Assuming that all the above requirements are met:

1. Place the QueuePusher package inside the source of Floodlight
2. That's it!
